= 1.0.0 =

Add a PDF filter to the media manager.

Add the reread-metadata function to the media manager.

Add better metadata string templates. You can use parentheses to delimit optional parts of a metadata template string. For example, not all media files contain {copyright} metadata.  If you put this into your metadata template string, it will omit the whole copyright clause if there's no {copyright}.

      (Copyright &copy; {copyright} )

The parentheses denote the whole clause as optional, and omitted if the metadata isn't available. Similarly, you can create a URL that will display a map, but only if latitude and longitude are available, like this:

     (<A href="https://maps.google.com/?ll={latitude},{longitude}&z=18" target="_blank">Map {title}</A>)
